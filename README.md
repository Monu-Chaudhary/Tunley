**ðŸŽ¯ GOALS ðŸŽ¯**
By the end of this lab you will be able to...
âœ… Use table views and custom cells in your apps to display a list of data to the user.
âœ… Use hardcoded data models to power their appâ€™s UI

**Features**
âœ… View a list of tracks with their title, artist and album cover in a table view using custom table view cells.
    - For this part of the project weâ€™ll be using hardcoded Track data models since the goal is to focus on navigation and table views. Weâ€™ll add networking in the next unit.
âœ… Users should be able to view the UI in any screen size and orientation.
    - For loading the track album cover, we'll use Nuke, a 3rd party image loading library installed via SPM.
âœ… Tapping on a track takes the user to detail screen where they can view more information about it (artist, album, etc.).
